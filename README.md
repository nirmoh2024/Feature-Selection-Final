The ipynb file contains the code to generate synthetic data for feature selection.
The synthetic data is inspired by applications in electronics. 
The datasets can be used to test the performance of feature selection algorithms.
Must execute all the cells sequentially from the start.
The LED dataset requires '16_segment_truth_table2' and 'XOR-MUX' files to be stored in the same location as the main file.
See https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.03035 for more details about the datasets.
